# Daily Standup Prep - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Product Overview

### 1.1 Product Vision
A simple, fast web application that helps developers and team members prepare for daily standup meetings by organizing their updates in the standard format: "What I did yesterday", "What I'm doing today", and "Blockers/Issues".

### 1.2 Problem Statement
- Team members often struggle to remember what they worked on the previous day during standup meetings
- Important blockers or achievements get forgotten without proper tracking
- Lack of preparation leads to longer, less focused standup meetings
- No centralized way to track daily progress and identify recurring blockers

### 1.3 Target Users
- Software developers
- Product managers
- Designers
- Any team member participating in daily standup meetings
- Remote workers who need better async communication

  - Yesterday's accomplishments (what I did)
  - Today's plan (what I'm doing today)
  - Blockers/Issues (impediments or help needed)
- **Auto-save functionality** as user types
- **Date-based organization** with automatic date selection
- **Edit previous entries** (up to 7 days back)

### 2.3 Entry History & Review

#### 3.2.2 Database Schema

```javascript
// Firestore Collections Structure

// Collection: users
users/{userId} = {
  email: string,
  displayName: string,
  createdAt: timestamp,
  lastLoginAt: timestamp,
  preferences: {
    timezone: string,
    reminderTime: string, // "09:00"
    theme: string // "light" | "dark"
  }
}

// Collection: standupEntries
standupEntries/{entryId} = {
  userId: string,
  date: string, // "2024-01-15" format
  yesterday: {
    items: array<string>,
    lastModified: timestamp
  },
  today: {
    items: array<string>,
    lastModified: timestamp
  },
  blockers: {
    items: array<{
      text: string,
      priority: string, // "low" | "medium" | "high"
      resolved: boolean,
      createdAt: timestamp
    }>,
    lastModified: timestamp
  },
  createdAt: timestamp,
  updatedAt: timestamp
}

// Collection: userSuggestions (for auto-complete)
userSuggestions/{userId} = {
  commonTasks: array<{
    text: string,
    frequency: number,
    lastUsed: timestamp
  }>,
  commonBlockers: array<{
    text: string,
    frequency: number,
    lastUsed: timestamp
  }>
}
```

### 3.3 Security Rules
```javascript
// Firestore Security Rules
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can only access their own data
    match /standupEntries/{document} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null 
        && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
      allow create: if request.auth != null 
        && request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.userId;
    }
    
    match /userSuggestions/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null 
        && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null 
        && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```
